# Web-Based-Facial-Authentication-System
A facial recognition system for user authentication.

This script uses the OpenCV library to capture video frames from the user's web camera and detect faces in the frames. It then uses a pre-trained facial recognition model to predict the user's identity based on their face. If the predicted identity is correct, the script will print a message saying "Hello, User!". Otherwise, it will print a message saying "Unknown user".
